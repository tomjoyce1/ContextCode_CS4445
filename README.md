This project monitors various system metrics from the local computer, such as battery level and CPU usage. 

It also uses an API to retrieve the real-time latitude and longitude of the International Space Station (ISS). 

A local collector gathers these continuously changing metrics and publishes them to a cloud platform hosted on PythonAnywhere. 

The cloud platform maintains a database storing historical data for analysis. A frontend UI provides users with a visual representation of both real-time system metrics and historical trends, enabling easy monitoring and insights.
